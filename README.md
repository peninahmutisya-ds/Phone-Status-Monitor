# ðŸ“± Phone Status Monitor Simulator  

A simple **Python OOP project** that simulates the behavior of a mobile phone.  
The simulator keeps track of your phoneâ€™s **battery, balance, and data**, and lets you perform everyday actions like charging, topping up, making calls, and browsing.

## ðŸ”‘ Features  
- **Battery Monitoring** â†’ charge the phone by time or by percent.  
- **Balance Tracking** â†’ top up in dollars and use it for calls or data.  
- **Data Management** â†’ buy data bundles with your balance.  
- **Call Simulation** â†’ make calls that reduce balance and battery.  
- **Browsing Simulation** â†’ browse the internet based on duration and usage profile:  
  - *Light* (chatting, light apps)  
  - *Normal* (social media)  
  - *Heavy* (video streaming)  
- **Status Display** â†’ check the phoneâ€™s current state with a simple battery bar.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Goals  
This project is designed for **beginners learning OOP in Python**.  
It demonstrates how:  
- **Classes** act as blueprints.  
- **Objects** represent real things (your phone).  
- **Attributes** store state (battery, balance, data).  
- **Methods** define actions (charge, call, browse).
